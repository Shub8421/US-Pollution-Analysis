# US-Pollution-Analysis

# **Objective**

The goal of this project is to analyze the air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.

# **Conclusions**

1. Geographic Hotspots
•	The most polluted cities are mainly large urban centers, especially in Colorado (Denver), California (Burbank, Los Angeles), and along the US-Mexico border (Tijuana, Mexicali).
•	These cities consistently show higher average NO2 and CO levels, which are linked to heavy traffic and urban activity.
•	Western states generally have higher pollution levels than many eastern states, likely due to a combination of population density, geography, and industrial activity.

2. Seasonal Patterns
•	NO2 and CO concentrations are highest in winter (December–February). This is likely due to increased heating, more vehicle idling, and atmospheric conditions (like temperature inversions) that trap pollutants near the ground.
•	Ozone (O3) peaks in the summer months, driven by sunlight and heat, which promote ozone formation.
•	SO2 patterns are more variable, often spiking in areas with specific industrial activities.

3. Yearly Pattern 
From 2006 to 2010, the Air Quality Index (AQI) for major pollutants showed a general downward trend, indicating an overall improvement in air quality:
•	Carbon Monoxide (CO) AQI steadily decreased, nearing 80 in 2009 and slightly dropping further in 2010.
•	Ozone (O₃) AQI showed a consistent decline, reaching around 206 in 2009 and dropping below 200 in 2010.
•	Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂) AQI gradually decreased to about 120 in 2009 and remained slightly above 100 in 2010.
•	Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) AQI declined from 2006 to 2009, reaching 107, and then dropped significantly to 22 by 2010, maintaining that level through 2019.
•	These trends suggest effective air pollution control measures during this period, with the most significant long-term improvement observed in NO₂ levels.

4.Yearly Statistic for Pollutants
Between 2006 and 2010, air quality showed a noticeable improvement across multiple pollutants:
•	Carbon Monoxide (CO): CO levels peaked in 2006, but both average and maximum values declined steadily through 2010, indicating a consistent improvement.
•	Ozone (O₃): Although the highest levels were recorded in 2008, average O₃ levels remained relatively constant. The highest AQI related to O₃ occurred in 2007, but subsequent years saw reduced extremes.
•	Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂): NO₂ levels peaked in 2007, yet average concentrations declined from 2006 to 2010, reflecting better air quality control over time.
•	Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂): SO₂ levels were highest in 2006, with a clear decreasing trend in both average levels and peak values in later years.
•	Air Quality Index (AQI): The highest AQI values for each pollutant were mostly concentrated in 2006–2007, with noticeably lower values in later years.

5. Public Health Implications
•	Urban populations are exposed to higher and more consistent levels of multiple pollutants.
•	Seasonal changes mean that different groups are at risk at different times of year (e.g., winter for NO2/CO, summer for O3).
•	Border regions face unique challenges, as pollution can cross international lines.
•	Industrial areas show distinct pollution spikes, especially for SO2.

6. Recommendations
•	Focus emission controls and public health interventions on winter months in urban areas.
•	Implement stricter vehicle emission standards in cities with high NO2 and CO.
•	Develop cross-border pollution management strategies, especially for cities like Tijuana and Mexicali.
•	Enhance monitoring and regulation in industrial zones with high SO2.

7.Percentage distribution of AQI categories
•	Border The overall air quality is generally safe, with the vast majority of pollutant readings—particularly for NO₂, SO₂, and CO—falling within the "Good" category. 
•	However, Ozone (O₃) stands out as the pollutant of most concern, showing the widest distribution across air quality categories and the highest percentage of readings in unhealthy ranges
•	This indicates that while short-term exposure to most pollutants may not pose a significant health risk, O₃ requires closer monitoring and potential mitigation efforts, especially due to its more frequent impact on sensitive groups and occasional spikes into unhealthy zones.
